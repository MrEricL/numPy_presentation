## Background

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MrEricL/numPy_presentation/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

[numPy](http://www.numpy.org) is a package for Python often used in scientific and mathematical projects. It's is useful for computation-intesensive projects. numPy is flexible as it works with other programming languages such as C,C++, and Fortran.

numPy was created by Travis Oliphant from an older math package called numeric, and is now mantained by a community.

### Getting Started
To install with pip enter into your terminal:
```
python -m pip install --user numpy
```

numPy works with a host of other packages. For a full list, try:
```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
```
These other packages covers other functinalities required for mathematical and scientific usage such as graphing.
